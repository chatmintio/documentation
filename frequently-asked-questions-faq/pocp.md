# POCP

**What is POCP?**

POCP (pronounced po-caps), short for "Proof-Of-Connection-Protocol", is the foundation of your Chatmint identity. It enables you to establish connections with others and initiate secure and meaningful conversations.

The foundational element of our Proof of Connection Protocol lies in the ERC1155 Standard, a transformative framework reshaping how users verify their identities and establish trust in the digital realm.&#x20;

The ERC1155 standard elevates security measures and ensures interoperability across diverse platforms and ecosystems. Users can trust in the safeguarding of their identities, fostering seamless interactions.

Recognised for its capacity to manage multiple token types within a single contract, ERC1155 provides unparalleled flexibility. This efficiency extends to the nuanced management of various aspects of digital identities.
