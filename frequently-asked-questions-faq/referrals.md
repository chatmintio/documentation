# Referrals

**Referral Program**

For those who have a Chatmint account, everyone has a unique referral code. For every referral, you and your friend will each receive 10 credits straight to both of your wallets.

Do note that if your referral has signed up previously without using your referral code, you would not be eligible for the extra credits.

**How to find and share your referral code**

On your profile, navigate to general and click refer for credits. From there, press the copy icon beside the invite code.

**Can I still use the referral code after I signed up?**

Unfortunately, we are unable to reverse it after an account has been created.
